# BatchVideoJSON   

BatchVideoJSON is a Lua script aiming to expand even further the funcionality already impemented by [Herik Tedesco's MediaJSON](https://github.com/heriktedesco/mediajson). This script run mediaJson for every single file inside of a directory, already excluding DCP folders (which currently don't work with MediaJSON). Further Updates may solve this issue for both MediaJSON and BatchVideoJSON.   


Usage: 
```
$batchvideojson TAPE\ NAME\ AND\ NUMBER
```
